## FUNFACT ABOUT ME🌟
Hey, I’m Abel! Let me spill some random facts about myself — maybe we have something in common? 😉
- I really love DURIAN — I can even eat a whole one by myself🥭
-  When I study, I enjoy listening to horror podcasts, especially stories about mountains ⛰️👻  
- Certified overthinker 🤯

## THINGS I WANT TO LEARN🤓
I’ve got tons of things I wanna dive into, not just geophysics, but also some random fun stuff:
- Coffee addict here ☕ — wanna learn how to actually make a proper cup, not just drink it.
- Programming 💻 — sounds cool, but I have no idea where to start (help 😅).
- Traveling ✈️ — My dream is to explore every country someday — hopefully not alone, but with someone who vibes the same way.
