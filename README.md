## FUNFACT ABOUT ME🌟
Hi, I'm Abel and I will tell you some facts about me❔
- I really love DURIAN — I can even eat a whole one by myself🥭
-  When I study, I enjoy listening to horror podcasts, especially stories about mountains ⛰️👻  
- I'm an overthinker

## THINGS I WANT TO LEARN🤓
I’ve got tons of things I wanna dive into, not just geophysics, but also some random fun stuff:
- Coffee addict here ☕ — wanna learn how to actually make a proper cup, not just drink it.
- Programming 💻 — sounds cool, but I have no idea where to start (help 😅).
- Traveling ✈️ — dream is to explore every single country, hopefully with someone I vibe with.
